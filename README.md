Churn Prediction Web Application

This is a web application built using Streamlit that predicts whether a customer will churn based on input data. The prediction is powered by a pre-trained machine learning model.

Features

User-friendly interface for data input.

Predicts customer churn with a trained machine learning model.

Displays the probability of churn alongside the prediction.

Technology Stack

Streamlit: For building the web application.

Scikit-learn: For training and saving the machine learning model.

Pandas: For data processing.

Joblib: For saving and loading the model and preprocessing pipeline.
